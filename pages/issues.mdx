# Issues

## All Versions

### Not all key presses register when holding down multiple keys
If you have this problem then I apologize but sadly I cannot do anything about it as this is a limitation of some keyboards.

### Transparency shows up as black in recording software
Ensure you've allowed transparency on ManiaKV's window in your recording software of choice.

### 6 Key gameplay doesn't work
This is due to a hacky system for assigning textures to key bindings, however, reworking the system has proven to be too big brain of a task for me to handle. With this being the case, don't expect this to be fixed for awhile.

## v0.1.1

### Application crashes after a fresh install
A bug in this version prevents ManiaKV from adding the `stage` property to its states file by default. This means you'll have to add it manually. (You should only have to do this once unless you do another fresh install)

Firstly, head over to the default install location of ManiaKV (`C:\Users\<yourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\ManiaKV`) or the location you chose to install it to, you should find a file in the `userdata` folder called `states.json`.

Next, open it with a text editor of your choice (Notepad, VSCode, etc.), then add a property called `stage` and set its value to "4k" (Or an ID of any stage defined inside of `config.json`).

Your file should look something like this afterwards:
```json
{
    "init": 1,
    "stage": "4k"
}
```

Finally save the file and launch ManiaKV. It should now open without any issues.
