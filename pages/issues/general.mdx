# General Issues

## Not all key presses register when holding down multiple keys
If you have this problem then I apologize but sadly I cannot do anything about it as this is a limitation of some keyboards.

## Transparency shows up as black in recording software
As far as I know this is a limitation of your recording software or OS so I can't do much about it.

## 6 Key gameplay doesn't work
This is due to a hacky system for assigning textures to key bindings, however, reworking the system has proven to be too big brain of a task for me to handle. With this being the case, don't expect this to be fixed for awhile.
