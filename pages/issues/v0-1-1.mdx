# v0.1.1 Issues

## Application crashes after a fresh install
A bug in this version prevents ManiaKV from adding the `stage` property to its states file by default. This means you'll have to add it manually. (You should only have to do this once unless you do another fresh install)

Firstly, head over to the default install location of ManiaKV (`C:\Users\<yourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\ManiaKV`) or the location you chose to install it to, you should find a file in the `userdata` folder called `states.json`.

Next, open it with a text editor of your choice (Notepad, VSCode, etc.), then add a property called `stage` and set its value to "4k" (Or an ID of any stage defined inside of `config.json`).

Your file should look something like this afterwards:
```json
{
    "init": 1,
    "stage": "4k"
}
```

Finally save the file and launch ManiaKV. It should now open without any issues.
