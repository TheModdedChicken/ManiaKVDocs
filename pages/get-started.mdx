# Getting Started

## Installation
To get started installing ManiaKV, head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/TheModdedChicken/ManiaKV/releases) and download the latest release.<br/>
Be sure to grab the installer that matches your OS and system architecture.

By default ManiaKV creates preconfigured userdata which contains the following:
- Bongo Cat Textures
- 4 key and 7 key layouts
- 2 key and 4 key Bongo Cat characters
- Internal en-us language file

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  **_IMPORTANT_**: If you are using version 0.1.1 then please head over to [this page](/issues/v0-1-1#application-crashes-after-a-fresh-install) before launching ManiaKV.
</Callout>

If this is all you want to use then feel free to ignore the rest of the setup and launch the application.<br/>
However, it is still recommended to continue reading to learn more about how to use ManiaKV.

## Setup
As of right now (v0.1.0 - v0.1.1) you need to manually modify your config file, however, in update 0.2.0 most if not all config settings will be in-app configurable.

To get started with modifing the config manually, head over to the folder that contains ManiaKV.<br/>
By default this folder is `C:\users\<yourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\ManiaKV`, however, if you chose a different location during the installation then head to that instead.

Your config file will be located inside the userdata folder: `userdata/config.json`<br/>
You may open this file with any text editor of your choosing. (Notepad, VSCode, etc.)

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  All file paths are relative to your `ManiaKV/userdata` folder.<br/>
  DO NOT add scope symbols to the beginning of file paths. (i.e. `./`, `/`, `~/`)
</Callout>

### Window
To start, let's set the [width](/config/properties#width-number---optional) and [height](/config/properties#height-number---optional) of the application window.

By default these are set to `1189` and `669` respectively, however, we'll be changing them to a smaller size for this example.

#### userdata/config.json
```json
{
  "window" : {
    "width": 594,
    "height": 334
  }
}
```
[_See other window properties_](/config/properties#window-object---optional)

---

### Characters
Now let's define a character to use on screen.

I'll be using Bongo Cat for this example, however, you may customize this how you'd like.

#### userdata/config.json
```json
{
  "characters": [
    {
      "id": "bongoCat4k",
      "keys": 4,
      "textures": {
        "body": "bongoCat4k/body.png",
        "instrument": "bongoCat4k/instrument.png",
        "leftIdle": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_idle.png",
        "rightIdle": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_idle.png",
        "key1": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_key1.png",
        "key2": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_key2.png",
        "key1-2": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_key1-2.png",
        "key3": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_key3.png",
        "key4": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_key4.png",
        "key3-4": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_key3-4.png"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
[_See other character properties_](/config/properties#characters-object---required)

To recap what we just did: 
- We set the [ID](/config/properties#id-string---required-1) of our new character. (This is used to call our character into a stage later)

- We set the amount of [keys](/config/properties#keys-number---required) our character can hold. (This can only be 2 or 4)

- We set the [textures](/config/properties#textures-object---required) our character is using.

---

### Stages
Finally, we can add a stage that will display our character.

#### userdata/config.json
```json
{
  "stages": [
    {
      "id": "4k",
      "keys": [ "A", "S", "SEMI_COLON", "SINGLE_QUOTE" ],
      "characters": [ "bongoCat4k" ],
      "shortcut": [ "CTRL", "SHIFT", "4" ],
      "background": "background.png",
      "table": "table.png"
    }
  ]
}
```
[_See other stage properties_](/config/properties#stages-object---required)

Again, to recap what we did: 
- We set the [ID](/config/properties#id-string---required) of our stage.

- We set the [keys](/config/properties#keys-string---required) our stage is using. (To find out what keycodes to use go [here](/config/keycodes))

- We specify the [characters](/config/properties#characters-object---required) we're using by their IDs.

- We set a keyboard [shortcut](/config/properties#shortcut-string---optional) for accessing this stage. (To find out what keycodes to use go [here](/config/keycodes))

- We set a [background](/config/properties#background-string---required) image.

- We set a [table](/config/properties#table-string---required) image.

---

### Complete File
Here is what our completed config file should look like:

```json
{
  "window" : {
    "width": 594,
    "height": 334
  },
  "characters": [
    {
      "id": "bongoCat4k",
      "keys": 4,
      "textures": {
        "body": "bongoCat4k/body.png",
        "instrument": "bongoCat4k/instrument.png",
        "leftIdle": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_idle.png",
        "rightIdle": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_idle.png",
        "key1": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_key1.png",
        "key2": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_key2.png",
        "key1-2": "bongoCat4k/leftPaw_key1-2.png",
        "key3": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_key3.png",
        "key4": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_key4.png",
        "key3-4": "bongoCat4k/rightPaw_key3-4.png"
      }
    }
  ],
  "stages": [
    {
      "id": "4k",
      "keys": [ "A", "S", "SEMI_COLON", "SINGLE_QUOTE" ],
      "characters": [ "bongoCat4k" ],
      "shortcut": [ "CTRL", "SHIFT", "4" ],
      "background": "background.png",
      "table": "table.png"
    }
  ]
}
```
